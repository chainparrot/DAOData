    "title": "[GIP-17] Multisig Reshuffle & Pausable Admin",
    "description": "This proposal is aimed at (1) rotating some multisigs signers and (2) setting up unpause role.\n\nGoing through the latest [Notion](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/July-2022-Monthly-Report-497d651cbf8849979f2ed6bdc5ddc7fa) report, you can notice that some singers are basically MIA. That is natural to expect given that multisigs were set up almost a year ago: some people have quit the industry or went offline more. Regardless of the reasons, it\u2019s not efficient and can at some point affect safety in times when asap multisig quorum is required. Current policies are [in docs](https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup/multisigs).\n\nYou can check this yourself: \nhttps://safestats.xyz/\n\n### Part 1: Rotating Signers\n\nTechnical Multisig\n\nSee [at the bottom of this page](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/July-2022-Monthly-Report-497d651cbf8849979f2ed6bdc5ddc7fa) how active or inactive a certain signer has been. It becomes logical that signer 0x1D35DFE2c3B9A0D9f200Ee70a62D73da832606CD has to be rotated out.\n\nCurrently, multisig is 6/9. I would propose a motion to add two new tech-knowledgeable signers and turn the technical multisig into 6/10. That still keeps the multisig extremely concervative, but improves the response time in critical situations. Volunteering members have so far been:\n\nhttps://gov.gearbox.fi/t/multisig-ceremony-apply/95\n\nAs such, suggesting to add:\n\n* 0xcD25fFc7888e0cA96014dC729394E8F09Faf7706 ([Alex from Graviton application](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/multisig-ceremony-apply/95/30))\n* 0x66a3c94814dc3a37C9d61f1a977ea3730c621426 ([Alex from Mellow application](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/multisig-ceremony-apply/95/29))\n\nFinancial Multisig\n\nThe same logic goes for the financial multisig too. It is currently 5/7 but can be upgraded to 5/9 as it would still keep the signer count significantly high yet improve the response time.\n\nRotating in:\n\n* 0xf3D476566BCC8E882A3910F1471428522449d89E (nikitakle)\n* 0x6D526f6b4C86FBdc8e359e6bef4Cd6a42aceA2d7 (amantay)\n\n### Part 2: Unpause Role Separation\n\nAs discussed in GIP-16, there are multiple approaches to security both before a protocol goes live (audits pre-deployment of anything new) and post-deployment (bug bounties, bot system, etc). To further increase security, the PAUSE function as having been executed in times when Immunefi bounties were confirmed, allowed the protocol to be paused (or some specific pools / Credit Managers / assets) immediately upon an issue discovery. This role has so far been in the hands of two addresses run by those have the knowledge of the system / have monitoring bots:\n\n* 0xD5C96E5c1E1C84dFD293473fC195BbE7FC8E4840\n* 0x65b384cecb12527da51d52f15b4140ed7fad7308\n\nHaving this PAUSE be under EOA control is not a centralization issue as it doesn\u2019t actually grant any other rights to these members. It only just pauses a system if there is an issue detected.\n\nHowever, when pausing, unintended consequences - such as untimely liquidations - can occur. In that case, nobody (be it a hacker, a developer, or whoever else) can actually benefit, but it could result in bad debt in the pools in case Credit Accounts\u2019 assets went below HF 1. As such, timely unpauses after resolving an issue are crucial. And, so far, with 6/9 or even 6/10, they still take over half a day, which is not acceptable. But still, it\u2019s a security-sensitive move (to unpause a system) so it can\u2019t be given to an EOA. So Part 2 aims at requesting the DAO\u2019s approval for:\n\n1. Separate the unpause functions into a new multisig\n2. The new multisig for unpause will be 3/10\n3. Same signers from the updated technical multisig will be here, no changes to the list.\n",

    "title": "Temporarily Pause ETH Borrowing",
    "description": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to pause ETH borrowing in the period leading up to the Ethereum Merge. \n\nIn addition, the original forum post also proposed transferring a one-time payment of 60 AAVE from the Aave treasury to the MakerDAO pause proxy in connection to the [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-ethpow-fork-risk-mitigation-plan/9438#:~:text=103%25%20to%201%2C000%25.-,AAVE%20Payment,-If%20this%20proposal). In this Snapshot vote, we also provide the options to vote for this payment.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAhead of the Ethereum Merge, the Aave protocol faces the risk of high utilization in the ETH market. Temporarily pausing ETH borrowing will mitigate this risk of high utilization.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFull details are provided in the original [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-ethpow-fork-risk-mitigation-plan/9438).\n\nThe risk of high utilization in the ETH market is driven by users potentially benefiting from the forked PoW ETH (ETHW) by borrowing ETH before the merge. High utilization interferes with liquidation transactions, thus increasing the chances of insolvency for the protocol. In addition, a high ETH borrow rate can make stETH/ETH recursive positions unprofitable, increasing the chances that users unwind their positions and drive the stETH/ETH price deviation further, causing additional liquidations and insolvency.\n\n\n## Specification\n* Calling `disableBorrowingOnReserve` to disable ETH borrowing.\n\nThe options for this Snapshot vote are as follows: \n\n1. Yes (temporarily pause ETH borrowing) and pay 60 AAVE tokens\n2. Yes (temporarily pause ETH borrowing) and decide on payment later. The community can revisit the proposed payment later, but that should not block the community from taking action (pause ETH borrowing) to derisk Aave in the interim\n3. No (do not pause ETH borrowing)\n4. Abstain\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-09-02.\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n\n",

    "title": "[Proposal #14] Ranking Golf Course Attributes",
    "description": "Summary: As we get deeper into the evaluation of golf courses and closer to purchasing LinksDAO\u2019s first golf course, we want to make sure that we\u2019re optimizing for the things that our community values the most. With this vote, you will force rank different attributes to tell us what matters the most to you to help guide which courses we evaluate and move forward with.\n\nSubmitters: LinksDAO Team\nFunding Requested: None\n\nMotivation: Maximizing community input into the decisions leading to our biggest milestone - the purchase of our first golf course!\nDetails: We want the community\u2019s input on what attributes matter the most when it comes to the first golf course that we purchase. \nAs with everything in life, there are always tradeoffs - we may see a course that is top 100 quality but isn\u2019t close to a major airport, or one that has 36 great holes but won\u2019t be open year round\u2026 - and these are the very real tradeoffs we\u2019ll have to make when choosing a course to purchase.\nTo get the community\u2019s input on what attributes are most important and how you would make these tradeoffs, we are holding a snapshot vote where each NFT holder force ranks various attributes according to its importance to them, with (1) being the most important attribute and (14) being the least important attribute. \n\nBelow are the attributes you will rank:\n\n- High course quality (at or near Top 100 level turf, architecture, maintenance)\n- Designed by a \u201cname brand\u201d / famous architect\n- Uniqueness of course (aesthetics, style)\n- Ability to play year round (no snow or extreme cold in winter)\n- Close to other public or reciprocal golf options\n- Walkable course (tees close to greens, not excessively hilly)\n- Playable by both low and high handicappers\n- Ready to play within months of purchase (little restoration required)\n- Near a major international airport (eg, within 90 minutes)\n- Has extensive practice facilities (range, short game, putting)\n- Has more than 18 holes (could be full or short course)\n- Has great clubhouse and bar / dining / event facilities\n- Has private lodging onsite / nearby\n- Has other amenities onsite (pool, tennis, pickleball, etc)\n\n\nPLEASE take the time to give thought to each attribute and rank them specifically for how important they are to you for LinksDAO\u2019s first course purchase.\n\nWe will look at a variety of metrics as we evaluate the results - % of votes giving an attribute the #1 ranking, % of votes giving an attribute a top 5 ranking, a composite score of all rankings (eg, #1 rank gets 14 points, #2 vote gets 13 points\u2026), and so on - and will share the results with the community. The output of this vote will give us valuable information to help inform what we optimize for as we are evaluating courses and choosing which courses we seriously pursue (and which we don\u2019t). It is particularly important now as we have loaded the \u201cfunnel\u201d with many potential courses and now need to start narrowing down to a smaller set of candidates.\nDisclaimer: this vote is not intended to be binding - for example, if an attribute gets the top ranking then it does not become a hard requirement for the course that is eventually purchased. BUT, the ranking will be a very important input into decision making throughout the course purchase process. \n\nVoting:\nRanked voting (not a yes/no vote): Rank all attributes from 1 to 14, where #1 is the attribute that is most important to you #1, and #14 is the attribute that is the least important.\n\nWithin Snapshot you will do this by clicking the options in the order of your ranking (click your top choice first, your 2nd choice second, and so on). Then, once you have ranked the full set of options, click \u201cVote\u201d to submit your ranking. Please rank all 14 options before submitting.\n\nNote: The results that you see on Snapshot are not the final results. Snapshot automatically calculates a ranked choice vote to determine a single winner, but we will be evaluating the entire ranking. We will release results separately once the vote is complete.\n\nQuorum: 500 votes\nDuration: 7 days",

    "title": "[AGIP42] Setting limits on the number of borrowed gotchis allowed per wallet address",
    "description": "**Authors:** eMM#9638, aargh#7037\n**GotchiIDs:** 23748, 6605 \n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter\u2019s wallet\n**Discourse Threads:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/from-days-to-blocks-modifying-the-new-renting-safeguards/4274\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/anti-botting-limits-on-rentals/4294\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/reform-public-rental-market/4089\n\nUntil recently there have been no limits on the number of gotchis an address can borrow at the same time, either from a whitelist or from the open (non whitelisted) market.\n\nThis was recently changed to a limit of 1 borrowed gotchi on the open market and 1 by default on all whitelists. A whitelist owner can change the number of allowed borrowed gotchis per address using Louper Dev, and soon, through the official UI.\n\nThis change was put in place with no warning as an experiment in anti botting measures. Community members had reported difficulty in securing a gotchi to borrow for channelling, particularly around the 0:00UTC reset time, which has been attributed to bots scraping all the best rental offers before humans get a chance.\n\nThe change has so far seen Gotchigang report an increase in available gotchis to borrow around reset time which is a positive.\n\nOn the negative side, other Gotchigang have reported being unable to fully channel their aaltars due to not being able to rent enough gotchis. This is particularly for borrowers who\u2019ve paid, say, 20ghst for a long term rental and are now stuck with that 1 gotchi and are unable to channel other parcels using other borrowed gotchis. This issue will tend to grow over time as people level up their aaltars and generate more channelling opportunities. The current limit on the open market is a disincentive to levelling up aaltars and purchasing more land for those without enough gotchis who prefer longer term rentals. It could also severely limit the demand for lending out gotchis long term, however it forces people to approach multiple guilds/whitelist owners for spots which is a positive for the social element of the game.\n\nA poll was run in the weekly DAO Hangout by CoderDan with the results suggesting most community members would prefer the allowed number of borrowed gotchis on the open market to reflect the number of parcels a wallet address holds plus 1, so in theory each parcel could be channelled once per day whilst still holding longer term rentals. For single channel rentals this is less of a concern as people can return a gotchi and borrow another as soon as they\u2019ve finished using it.\n\nFurther increasing the borrowing limit up to the number of available channellings per address was suggested by considering aaltar levels as well, but it was deemed too inefficient to be constantly recalculating this number dynamically in the background.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/892307846010658856/1008035273168392243\n\nAs this was an experiment, I propose we revert these changes back now and continue to monitor the impacts so we can be clearer on the severity of the botting issue and be more confident in the effectiveness of this solution, whilst voting to implement the below.\n\nOnce this experimental change is reverted, voting for option 1 in this proposal will set in place the following:\n\n- Set a limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower\u2019s wallet plus 1.\n\nVoting Options:\n\n1. Set the limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower\u2019s wallet plus 1.\n2. Keep the original unlimited system and do nothing further, allowing unlimited numbers of borrowed gotchis per address both on the open market and through whitelists.\n3. Leave the open rental market to allow unlimited gotchis to be borrowed, but set the default to 1 on all whitelists (and implement the ability for whitelist creators to change the limit per whitelist.)\n4. Use a limit of 1 gotchi per address across whitelists and the open market, while WL owners can adjust the number as seemed appropriate.",

    "description": "**Author:** Dr Wagmi#6629\n**GotchiID:** 16635\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter\u2019s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/sunset-frens-by-october-1st/4255\n\nI propose that we cease FRENS emissions immediately. FRENS emissions have been used as a liquidity mining (LM) incentive by providing GHST holders and liquidity providers access to future content through the raffle system. While this was an initially effective tool for LM, it is now doing more harm than good. Outlined below and in the forum thread are the reasons why Aavegotchi should sunset FRENS:\n\n- Eliminating FRENS will reduce Aaveogotchi protocol pressure to hold dilutional events by eliminating ongoing \u201ccontent debt\u201d created by FRENS emissions\n- GHST has alternative staking utility with GLTR liquidity mining\nShifting focus to alchemica/GLTR pairs reallocates LM rewards to asset holders who are more directly providing value to the ecosystem in the form of liquidity vs single-sided GHST staking which provides limited and historically overcompensated value\n- Future content events can generate protocol revenue instead of paying out content debt. This allows for a more sustainable revenue stream for Pixelcraft and the Aavegotchi DAO\n- The value of future content can be captured on-chain with GLTR/Alchemica/GHST instead of off-chain with FRENS\n- Capturing on-chain value of the above native assets will significantly add utility to all tokens\n- Current FRENS and raffle ticket holders must be acknowledged with raffle(s). There are multiple avenues for this which are outlined in the DAO forum thread. The community can design and publicize events to utilize these FRENS which will be an easier task if we stop further emissions and narrow the scope of the raffle with cessation of FRENS\u2019 emissions.\n\nThere will be an additional signal proposal outlining changes to GLTR emissions to support liquidity provision for the GHST token specifically. While the bonding curve is in place, it is important that a sustainable GHST liquidity plan is in place that captures and rewards LPs fairly and sustainably.\n\nDr Wagmi\n",

    "description": "GMX on FTX\n\nFTX.com proposes to list the GMX token on their spot market with a GMX:USD pair.  Introducing the GMX token and platform to a wider audience and marking the first Arbitrum native protocol listed on FTX.\n\nFTX is not seeking marketing investments or listing fees from GMX. GMX may support future co-marketing activities on a case-by-case basis as part of its ongoing marketing.\n\nFTX supports fast withdrawals on Arbitrum and Avalanche for the leading tokens within GLP and will initially offer GMX deposits and withdrawals on Arbitrum and will evaluate expanding to such features for additional chains.\n\nActions for Approval\n\nAllocate up to 15% of GMX protocol-controlled liquidity from existing platforms to the extent required towards maintaining liquidity for the GMX:USD pair on\u00a0FTX.com.\n \nAllow core contributors to take all other actions reasonably required to establish the listing and support its ongoing activities in the future.\n\nProtocol controlled liquidity will only be deployed to support spot trading on FTX.com, it is not being approved to support trading on FTX.US or FTX Futures. \n\nContinued support to FTX spot markets using protocol-controlled liquidity is subject to FTX engaging (directly or through contributors) and getting agreement from GMX DAO governance before expansion of GMX trading on other markets including FTX.US and FTX Futures.\n\nGMX Liquidity\n\nLiquidity on Uniswap v3 (Arbitrum) and Trader Joe (Avalanche) are managed by the operational multi-sig.\n\nLiquidity on Bybit Spot is managed by a Market Maker via a software agreement, to ensure that the protocol controlled liquidity is maintained in the appropriate price bands . The same arrangement would be applied for the FTX market.\n\nDiscussion: https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-on-ftx/554",

Sometimes I see ultra rare Squad sold on really slow price, like they were common ones.\nIt would be nice to see some ranking list of the Squad based on rarity, and for example, the more rare the Squad is, the more cake in the IFO you can commit.\nWe could maybe implement some pool/farm bonus to the Squad owner which gives the bonus based on rarity.\n\nI don't know, these are some utilities that came to my mind, but actually anything else would be super. What do you think?\n",

    "description": "I propose to increase the APR of staking and liquidity providing to reward the active users of Pancakeswap.\n\nWith low APRs (and getting lower due to votes) we are not incentivising people to use Pancakeswap directly, if CAKE has little to no emmisions at all why use Pancakeswap? Just hold your CAKE in an exchange, much easier.\n\nI don't think people fully understand the effect of emissions, think of emissions as a company giving stock dividends instead of cash, let's say 4% stock dividend, nothing happens at all, because everybody gets 4% (This is not the case for Pancakeswap since we have burns).\n\nHowever not all CAKE holders get the best returns. Let's go back to the dividend example, some people get the 4%, some don't, in this scenario the 4% return guy actually gets something because he gets more compared to others. This is a good way to reward people who actually use Pancakeswap.\n\nIf CAKE emmisions go to zero, there will be no more staking and rewards for providing liquidity is very low. What do you think will happen to Pancakeswap if that occurs?\n\nHere's another one, people just get excited over high APRs even if it's pure inflation. (to reiterate CAKE is not purely inflationary due to burns).\n\nFrom what I see most people want CAKE to be deflationary, which is great, but not the best option. If what you want is to get the maximum amount of value, increasing emissions is the best option. If you're reading this you're one of the people going to benefit from higher emissions. \n\nI'm not proposing to increase the emissions to max immediately, there are people who want the exact opposite of what I'm proposing after all. \n\nDeflation can still be achieved, what we need to do is focus on deflationary products, instead of trying to force it through lower emissions.\n\nWe get more burns if more people use the platform, increasing emissions will get us more users.\n\nThank you for reading, let's continue to make this a great community.",

(from fees).\n\n\nExample of trading bot setup\nParameter 5-20\n100 orders\n\nSo if cake hits 5 you will have 100% cake and if cake hits 20 your will have 100% stables. In between 5 to 20 there would be 100 sell/buy orders. So imagine the account of trading fees and lp rewards being generated. This would mean more cake will be burnt and more rewards will be given. In my opinion the lp rewards will be much more higher than now. \n\n",

As for pancakeswap it would be like setting a deadline to have 0 emissions or below before we hit the max supply. \n\nHere is the plan:\nMaximum supply will be set at 500m which would take over 2 years for it to hit. Pancakeswap will do everything within 2 years to bring emissions down to 0 or negative to prevent it hitting 500m.\n\nIf pancakeswap fails to achieve it then once we hit 500m cake all new minting will be paused and rewards will be given out from NFT fees, IFO, transaction fees etc....  Please note by then we may have even features that would burn cake like gamification, margin, lending and borrowing. \n\n\n\n",

The tokens are then used to purchase/bid for new pancakeswap NFT and are recycled back to stakers. \n\nThe tokens are tradeable and price is determined by the community. If you choose to sell/buy the token there will be a 5% tax so keeping/farming your own is encouraged. \n\nBenefitting Cake\n1. Less people will be staking in normal pools/farms = higher APY\n2. A new cake nft token can give you another source of income that could be better than current farms. \n3. Cake will have higher demand\n\nNote: figures can be changed, but its just an example of a system that i think will benefit cake. ",

To do this, we should continue attracting more people to put their money down, buy CAKE, and leave it locked in through attractive staking rewards.",
